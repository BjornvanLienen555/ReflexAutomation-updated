Currently to-do:
CreateDespatchNotes_for_PT_copy.feature does fully randomize things, but the json is made for VolleDozen. 
This can be noted when going from fully randomized items to only randomized items that are from VolleDozen, as this reduces the errors.
However, even with the reduction of errors, they still appear since the VolleDozen items in ItemsForPT.csv are the only ones that don't produce any errors.
For the sake of testing, the old file still remains, and should remain, until the error issue is resolved.
