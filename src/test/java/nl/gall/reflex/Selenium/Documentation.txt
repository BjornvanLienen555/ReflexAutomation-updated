There is a READ ME.txt available on how to work with Selenium. 
There is also a note surrounding the error in keywords.robot, assuming it has not been fixed yet.

Outside that:
test.robot is the executable test

auth.robot is the file that has authorisation data and needs to be adjusted for security reasons

keywords.robot is the main keyword file, although if expanded upon, 
needs to be seperated for the sake of information management.
Any file that is made as an expansion is labeled with keywords_ to keep them organized

keywords_common.robot contains keywords that have been identified to be used in more than 1 occasion 
or selenium inputs that are too long that have been shortened for ease

keywords_manage_receipts contains keywords that are used throughout the manage receipt window

variables.robot is the main variable file, although if expanded upon, 
needs to be seperated for the sake of information management

xpathvariables.robot is a variable file made for xpaths that are used multiple times
(+ data that is only used for those variables)

xpaths.robot is not used anywhere as a resource, 
because it just contains the xpaths known for specifics that are either unused, 
or just for the sake of having an easy xpath library without needing to constantly check
