GATHER DATA FROM REFLEX
To inspect page: CTRL+SHIFT+C
This opens up the console drawer, keep this open.
Click the element you want to inspect to highlight the element.
Scroll to make sure you have the correct element, and not an element that interacts with the element you want to directly interact with.
(As an example, the date input element has an element that prevents the search bar from accidently being used, 
clicking it with the mouse allows you to change the date manually, but for Selenium use, you need the input element directly)
After inspecting, to inspect again, use CTRL+SHIFT+C or use the inspect button in the console drawer.

IMPLEMENT DATA FROM REFLEX
Unique XPath identificators get randomized, so make sure to get the full XPath or get really specific with multiple identificators
To get the full XPath: Right Click the inspected element>Copy>Copy full XPath
Also make sure that you use xpath=/ before pasting the full XPath. (so you get xpath=//html, the xpaths in xpaths.robot already have an extra slash)
There are some exceptions, where the XPath does work with multiple identificators, in which case:
Right Click the inspected element>Copy>Copy XPath
Then change the @id identificator with an @class, @title or any other seemingly unique identificator and specify as such:
//*[]
This is not preferred due to very few identificators being actually unique, even in multitude, 
but in the cases where the XPath works, it's preferable for readability. 
But default to full XPaths untill a unique XPath has been found

EXECUTE TEST.ROBOT
Make sure to change directory to the selenium folder with "cd src\test\java\nl\gall\reflex\selenium"
Then execute file in the terminal with "robot test.robot"
You can go back in the directory with "cd..."

SELENIUM QUIRKS WITH REFLEX
There is a CustomLib.py dedicated to trying to focus the window. 
Everytime a window is opened through human input, it is always in focus, through automation, it sometimes is not.
For consistency, there is CustomLib.py, but CustomLib.py is not setup properly yet and should be looked at if possible
